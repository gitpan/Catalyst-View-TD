Revision history for Perl extension Catalyst::View::TD.

0.12    2009-11-14T17:20:40
        - Added MRO::Compat declaration to support `next::method()` as
          appropriate.

0.11    2009-11-03T00:17:46
        - Fixed some broken links, including the repository link in META.yml.
        - Fixed POD in the helpers so that the templates embedded in them are
          not rendered.
        - Switched from `use parent` to `use base` for internal inheritance,
          since it's atually an optional module.
